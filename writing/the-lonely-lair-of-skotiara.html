          <p>Ancient and evil is Skotiara, weaving her loom in wait for the farmer’s son now approaching. Despite chitinous claws, she works gracefully, spinning a story of beauty, long forsaken. Her mouth waters: while animals are gamey and tough, humans are succulent and soft, and she is ravenous.</p>

          <p>A puddled splash, by sandaled foot, captures her attention, and her appendages blossom to bear her from hiding hole and down the long tunnel.</p>

          <p>His name is Panagiotis, son of Themistoklis, and his age marks that precipice where boyhood feels forever and becoming a man stays impossibly far. His tunic rides easy on a sinewy frame, and his muscles are full from the field. His right hand clasps his father’s half-sword, its tip nicking shadows as he cleaves the path before him.</p>

          <p>He imagines the coming morning, whilst scaling boulders and stooping through chambers, emerging victorious and brandishing her dripping head before a rejoicing village. He savors this thought as he enters the deepest and dankest cave chamber.</p>

          <p>It is stygian here and only now, shivering, does he recognize the carcasses and the cold.</p>

          <p>A new possibility is imagined and his weapon slips, reverberating clangs against the stone. He drops to his knees and fumbles for the blade, his father would lament its loss, but before he can seize it, a papery, slithery screech from above demands him.</p>

          <p>It’s the creature Skotiara, intoxicating, snarling, her many claws radially spread, her gaping maw a chasm, and she envelops him now in a writhing embrace.</p>
