          <p>It was the first day in a week that Carol’s masked captor hadn’t appeared at the top of the basement steps, plastic tray in hands, bearing oatmeal and steaming English tea. Both were prepared just the way she took them and she’d nearly driven herself mad attempting to figure just exactly who he was.</p>

          <p>His mask offered no clues; just a brown sack with empty holes cut for the eyes, and his silence was only broken by a single, whispered number after she’d consumed each morning’s meal.</p>

          <p>He'd startled her the first time with a throaty SEVEN, before collecting up her dishes. She'd wailed to him then, begging to know why this was happening, as he'd trudged upstairs and switched the lights off with a definitive click.</p>

          <p>Each day the number counted down.</p>

          <p>Yesterday's ONE had lingered with her, throbbing hard in her chest, and upon hearing she'd fought to keep from retching up the oats, knowing when the moment finally came she’d need every ounce of strength.</p>

          <p>A car pulled into the driveway. Its door slammed and gravelly steps walked onto the porch.</p>
          
          <p>A screen door whined and keys jangled.</p>

          <p>Steps led down the hallway into the kitchen.</p>

          <p>Minutes passed.</p>

          <p>Carol restrained herself as the man padded down the stairs. He carried the usual tray and through the holes, she saw that his pupils were steady and calm. He waited until she finished eating.</p>

          <p>“Oatmeal depleted. Went shopping. Got value pack.”</p>

          <p>Her mouth dropped.</p>

          <p>He gathered the dishes.</p>

          <p>“FORTY-SEVEN.”</p>
