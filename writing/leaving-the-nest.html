          <p><em>Author's Note:</em> This was for the third and <a href="https://www.nycmidnight.com/masterlists/250mfc2024-finalround" target="_blank">final round</a> of NYC Midnight's 250-Word Microfiction Challenge 2024. My genre was open, action was 'slipping', and word was 'harp'. I unfortunately didn't win but am still happy with how it turned out.</p>

          <p>It’s breakfast and I struggle to process what’s playing on my son’s iPad. Max, six-years old, shovels down cereal while something angular carves through the air over the fields of Eastern Europe.</p>
          
          <p>“Watching TV?”</p>
          
          <p>The POV shifts to first person and now we’re hurtling down a trench. Max snorts—keeping his eyes on the tablet—as we ram into a terrified soldier, his hands flailing. I catch a Russian arm patch and sickeningly recognize battlefield footage. Max grins at my shock, about to drop some memorized fact.</p>

          <p>“The ‘A’ in HARPY stands for au-ton-o-mous,” he says, enunciating each syllable.</p>

          <p class="story-break">* * *</p>
          
          <p>Years later, a HARPY cruising the border mistakenly murders a citizen. My son listens to a podcast while talking heads debate the slippery slope of deploying these weapons so close to home. Leaked footage reveals a diving, metallic raptor overtaking a fleeing figure and Max, opening a soda, mumbles that he watched this clip already.</p>

          <p>Apparently, the machine shrieked in Spanish while taking the man apart.</p>

          <p class="story-break">* * *</p>

          <p>There’s a tragedy unfolding and I’m glued to my phone. Some maniac has acquired a HARPY and for reasons unknown, unleashed it upon his campus. The livestream shows a bloodied, feathery machine wearing a woman’s face, skittering through a high school hallway. A student stands frozen as the bird-creature screeches, lacerating him with chrome claws.</p>

          <p>The room reels as I suddenly recognize my son and the feed cuts out, but not before the thing kicks off into the air, hauling my screaming boy into the pale sky.</p>
