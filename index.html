      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
      
      <p>I'm Conlan. For the longest time I believed I was a technologist. Having grown up in Silicon Valley and reared on tech founder mythologies, I decided to drop out of high school at sixteen, sequestering myself away, and under the tutelage of the internet began teaching myself Java programming. Like a butterfly, I emerged two years later from my dungeon bedroom and hit the streets of 2007 Craigslist, in search of a startup in need of interns. After a series of awkward cold calls and cringe interviews, I managed to land an internship with a mobile photo sharing platform aimed at people who “owned a cameraphone”. The rest was history. From that moment on, I believed myself and technology to be fated, thinking I was destined for tech greatness.</p>
      
      <p>It’s taken me nearly twenty years to realize that I’m actually an artist (specifically a writer) and that this entire time I was merely collecting source material for my debut novel.</p>
